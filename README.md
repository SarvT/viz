## 🚀 Introduction
**Viz** is a powerful algorithm visualizer that provides interactive and intuitive visualizations for sorting algorithms, pathfinding techniques, and binary tree operations. Built with **Next.js, TypeScript, ShadCN, and Tailwind CSS**, it offers a seamless and visually appealing experience for learners and enthusiasts.

## ✨ Features
- **Sorting Visualizer** 📊  
  Visualizes popular sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Pathfinding Visualizer** 🛤️  
  Demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms with an interactive grid:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A* Algorithm
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm

- **Binary Tree Visualizer** 🌳  
  Helps understand binary tree structures and operations:
  - Tree construction
<!--  - In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversal-->

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript)
- **UI Components:** ShadCN, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Hooks
